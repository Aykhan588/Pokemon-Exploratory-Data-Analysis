# Pokemon-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
I conducted an analysis to understand the dynamics of the pokemon universe through data. I investigated the missing values to get some simple calculations in. I calculated the win percentage of each pokemon which helped me learn more about which pokemon win. Then I could dive deeper to try and determine which stats contribute most to winning or which type of pokemon win the most. I continually increased the granularity of our analysis to derive a better understanding. I then looked at the shape of the data frames and found a very interesting anomaly. I found the top 10 Pokemon with the worst win percentage and the top 10 with the best win percentage. Finally, I visualized the total pokemon by Type 1 and Type 2 using a box plot. Detailed conclusions of exploratory data analysis can be found on my personal GitHub Link. This project was completed using Python
